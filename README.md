# List-folders-using-C-program
"list_directories.c" is the main program and solution for this problem.
Here  I used GCC compiler to compile the program using Terminal
used commandline:"gcc list_directories.c -o list_linux"
after the compilation,i saved output file as "list_linux"
To execute this output file: "./list_linux" in terminal
after execute the executable file u wil the folders and files which in the path.
This is my output for your reference:(my path is: "/home/yuvaraj/Documents")
